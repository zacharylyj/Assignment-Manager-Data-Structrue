now I want to be able to have variables in the expression

when getting a = c+7
first look through the tree and if a variable is found recursive the function to look into that variable.
it will look at the dictionary key "c" and evaluate the item, it then use the value of "c" 
if c = 5 + d evaluate d first
if c = None return "a" as None
if c = a print (f"Circular dependency detected involving '{var}'")

example
{'d': 'y', 'a': '(3 + (4 * 5))', 'c': 'a ** 2', 'b': 'a + c', 'y': None}
